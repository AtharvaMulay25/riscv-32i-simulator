      content="Functional Simulator for a subset of RISC-V Instruction Set. RISC-V is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that has gained popularity in recent years due to its simplicity and extensibility. The simulator reads encoded instructions from a memory file (machine code), decodes, executes, and writes back the results to a register file."
